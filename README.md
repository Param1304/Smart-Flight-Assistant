# **Smart Flight Assistant ✈️** 
This is an end-to-end ML-powered web application to predict flight delays based on parameters input by user, compare airlines performance by analyzing past flight records and estimating CO2 emissions. It is a useful travel-planning assistant for air commuters. 

## **📌 Features**  
✅ Implemented an FT-Transformer model using PyTorch Tabular, achieving a normalized MAE of 0.0023 for delay prediction, outperforming traditional models like Random Forest and XGBoost.

✅ Built a Django-based web app with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Plotly.js for interactive visualizations, enabling users to
 predict delays, compare airlines, and calculate CO2 footprints

✅  Deployed a scalable, user-friendly interface with MVC architecture, integrated with GPU-accelerated training (Kaggle
 P100) and exportable model pipelines (TorchScript/ONNX).

✅ Enhanced operational efficiency and passenger experience by providing actionable insights for airlines and travelers, with
 future plans for real-time data integration and global scalability
